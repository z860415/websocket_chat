# WebSocket Chat

##### A Websockets chat server and client. It is written purely as a demo of Websockets functionality and probably servces no useful purpose!

##### The server is written in Python 3 using  `FastAPI`, `asyncio` and the `websockets` library.

##### If you are using a Python version below 3.4, you will need to manually install the asyncio library as it is not included.

## **To start the server:**

* **Install dependencies for the server (preferably in a virtualenv):**
```py
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* **Run the server on port 8000:**
```py
$ python3 main.py
```
