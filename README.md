##### A Websockets chat server and client. It is written purely as a demo of Websockets functionality and probably servces no useful purpose!

##### The server is written in Python 3 using  `FastAPI` and the `websockets` library.

##### Web framework for building APIs with `Python 3.6+` based on standard Python type hints.

## **To start the server:**

* **Install dependencies for the server (preferably in a virtualenv):**
```py
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* **Run the server on port 8000:**
```py
$ python3 main.py
```
